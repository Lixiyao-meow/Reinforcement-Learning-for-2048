# Reinforcement-Learning-for-2048
We use two different approches to solve the 2048 game. 

This repository contains:
1. Policy Neural Network 
2. Monte Carlo Game Search

The Neural Network did not give a satisfying result, but Monte Carlo Tree Search has outstanding performance in 2048 game playing.
