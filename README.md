# Reinforcement-Learning-for-2048
We use two different approches to solve the 2048 game. You can find a detailed report in this repository explaining our implementation and the results we got with each method.

The second one is based on the Mikhai lLenko's code: https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/tree/master/AI-plays-2048

This repository contains:
1. Policy Neural Network 
2. Monte Carlo Game Search

The Neural Network did not give a satisfying result, but Monte Carlo Tree Search has outstanding performance in 2048 game playing.

# To run the 2048 game and play it with our AI

python3 game_display.py

Then press "P" to launch the AI.
